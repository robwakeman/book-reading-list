# book-reading-list

## About

Book reading list app.

This app is just for the purposes me testing out coding practices:

- The app uses native JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
- ES2015 is used e.g. const, let, arrow functions.
- CSS uses BEM methodology.
- Flexbox is used for some layout.
- The project is too small to justify the use of Sass.
- Form elements contain ARIA attributes for accessibility.

The book list is static and hardcoded.

## TODO

Replace static list of books with JSON data from a suitable API.
