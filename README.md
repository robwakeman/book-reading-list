# Book Reading List

## About

Book reading list app.

This app is just for the purposes me testing out coding practices:

- **HTML**
  - Form elements contain ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- **CSS**
  - CSS uses BEM methodology.
  - Flexbox is used for some layout.
  - The project is too small to justify the use of Sass.
- **JavaScript**
  - The app uses native JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
  - ES6 (ES2015) is used e.g. const, let, arrow functions, for..of loops.
  - Babel is not used to compile the JavaScript down to ES5 as this is not for production.

The book list is static and hardcoded.

## TODO

Replace static list of books with JSON data from a suitable API.
